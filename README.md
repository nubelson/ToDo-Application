# To-Do Application

![TODO Preview](./todo.png)

This is a very simple to-do application made with React and Redux to train some knowledge in State management.
It allows the creation and removal of to-dos, including the possibility to delete all to-dos at once.
Because it is such a simple application, I could have done it using only React's Context API.

You can also see the Design of the application [here](https://www.figma.com/file/5lqv2bMpmNIwg9OIrQFU1u/Todo-App).
